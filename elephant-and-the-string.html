<p>I started very casually, the goal was to do 3ish LeetCode problems a week. I followed the recommendations of reddit and glassdoor job seekers, work on the problem, try to create your solution. Then verify with the answers. It was a grind. I took almost an hour per problem and by the time i tried looking at the answer, it was like i had a mental block for solutions other than my own.</p>
<p>After like 2 weeks, due to laziness and general frustration, I adopted another method. Take a problem, search for a brief description of the solution on <a href="https://geeksforgeeks.org">GeeksForGeeks</a>, then attempt to write the solution. Sounds like cheating but I found myself flying through 4-5 problems a day. More importantly, I was able to <em>SEE</em> the possible solutions faster. There's nothing worse in a technical interview than coming up blank on approaches. It's a vicious cycle. The longer you take, the more stressed you get trying to think of something and the harder it becomes.</p>
<p>For a long time, I think I had doubts about truly "going for it" and applying to the top tech companies. We all struggle with imposter syndrome sometimes. I'm always shocked talking to friends who are brilliant software engineers disqualify themselves from even applying.</p>
<p>"I'm not ready"</p>
<p>"I need to get more experience first"</p>
<p>All of that might be true. Or it might not. But the fastest way to find out is to try. The hardest step is probably the first, deciding that you are good enough to apply for the AppAmaBookGoSofts of the world.</p>
