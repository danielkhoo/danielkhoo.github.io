I am also dabbling in LeetCode challenges which are always mindblowing, forcing you to consider weird edge cases.</p>\n<p>So in no real order of priority, cause I'll change my mind anyway, here's the stuff I hope to learn/do in the next 6 months:</p>\n<h3>Books</h3>\n<p>Been meaning to get both of these forever but I keep missing sales on them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clean Code by Robery C. Martin</li>\n<li>Refactoring by Martin Fowler</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JAMStack</h3>\n<p>I feel like this is the way web dev is heading. Away from monolithic tightly coupled front/back ends.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GraphQL</li>\n<li>Gatsby</li>\n<li>Serverless - AWS Lambda (I have credits to burn)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Leetcode</h3>\n<p>Dislike how reliant I am on intellisense and excessive run cycles to produce code. Gonna force myself to code without all the modern convenience.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete 50 problems</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>React stuff</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Storybook - Build a personal library of reusable components with all accessibility/responsive behvaviours built in.</li>\n<li>Extract more common logic into custom reusable Hooks.</li>\n</ul>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
